          Integrated Health Otago was established in 2014 by Jim, after over a decade of planning a 
          health care service that addresses the specific needs of each individual client with both acute and chronic conditions.
          Jim is qualified as an Osteopath, Physiotherapist and Digestive Health Practitioner who has worked in the public and private 
          sectors as well as with high profile football teams and elite British Athletes.

          Jim’s vision was to combine Osteopathic philosophy, where the body is considered a complex 
          integrated system, with biomechanics, muscle balance and rehabilitative techniques of Physiotherapy.
          Together with his wife Deb, they have grown IHO to combine allied health services such 
          as digestive health and acupuncture in order to provide a progressive all round health 
          care model that is unique to their clinic.

          Osteopathy is a way of detecting, treating and preventing health problems by moving, 
          stretching and massaging a person's muscles and joints. Osteopathy is based on the principle 
          that the wellbeing of an individual depends on their bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue 
          functioning smoothly together.
